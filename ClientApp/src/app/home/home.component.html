<h1>Populate Table With List of Heroes</h1>

<p>Delete Example data and make list dynamic using a angular service file that calls an api on HeroesController to get the heroes from db</p>
<p>Also make the Add Hero link in nav go to a new page with a form that will add a new Hero to Heroes table in db and then redirect back to this page.  Do not worry about validating duplicate hero names</p>
<p>The delete button should flag the hero in the db as IsActive = 0</p>

<app-hero-list></app-hero-list>
